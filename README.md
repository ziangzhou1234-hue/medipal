Description：
This project showcases a medication assistant developed in Python. Using a lightweight command-line tool, it helps users take medication on time, record symptoms, analyze trends, and export data, thereby improving adherence and supporting medical communication.

Features include comprehensive functionality: medication management, daily medication schedule, medication outcome tracking, symptom recording, and weekly adherence and symptom insights.
The code is a pure standard library CLI, cross-platform compatible, features color-coded output (ANSI), a clear data model, and lightweight statistical analysis.
Advantages include dependency-free operation, cross-platform compatibility, clear structure, user-friendly interface (color-coded prompts can be disabled), SON persistence + CSV export, and easy backup and secondary analysis.

It transforms "on-time medication + symptom management" into a recordable, quantifiable, and shareable daily habit with minimal cost.
